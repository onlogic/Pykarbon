====================
The Pykarbon Project
====================

The Pykarbon module provides a set of tools for interfacing with hardware devices on
OnLogic's 'Karbon' series rugged PCs. These interfaces include the onboard CAN bus,
Digital IO, automotive features, and a few other hardware devices. There are several benefits to leveraging Pykarbon:

- You can start testing and developing right out of the box -- setting up a Karbon with Pykarbon and sending some test messages over CAN takes only a couple of minutes.
- High level interface offers powerful tools that can be immediately applied to a broad variety of problems.
- Low level hardware access layer gives developers granular control when they need it.
- Abstracts complex hardware controls into simplified interfaces.
- Free and open; Pykarbon can be downloaded, modified, and used in any application.


The ultimate goal of this package is to provide a simple, but powerful, base platform that will allow
for the quick and easy integration of a Karbon system into a variety of applications.
